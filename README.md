# PSU Payment Gateway
This is a demo payment provider for the Bachelor in Software Development at University College Nordjylland. The purpose is to learn how to integrate different systems and as such this payment provider is a part of a larger setup.
This is a ASP.NET Core Web API solution with Swagger for documentation. The Dockerfile will build this solution in release mode, meaning that there are no swagger in that solution.

It is possible to throttle the solution to limit how many requests it is able to handle. This is managed in the ´´appsettings.json´´ file.
